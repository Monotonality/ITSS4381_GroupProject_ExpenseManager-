# ITSS 4381 Group Project: Expense Manager Web App

## Overview
[cite_start]This project is an AI-assisted web application that extends the Part 1 command-line expense manager into a full web-based system[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The application was created using vibe coding techniques and AI tools like Cursor[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The goal was to quickly build a working web app that leverages what we learned about prompt engineering and AI-assisted development[cite: 6].

The application allows users to track and manage their personal expenses through a simple, interactive web interface.

## Project Structure
* **`app.py`**: The main Python file containing the web application logic (e.g., using a framework like Flask).
* **`expenses.csv`**: The data file where all transaction information is stored.
* **`templates/`**: A directory containing the HTML files for the web application's frontend.
* **`static/`**: A directory for static files such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript.
* [cite_start]**`prd.md`**: The Product Requirements Document outlining the app's goals, users, and key features[cite: 11].
* **`GROUP PROJECT PT 1 - 8 (1).py`**: The original Part 1 command-line application.

## Features
The web application includes the following features:
* [cite_start]**Add Expense**: An interactive form to submit new expenses with details like name, amount, date, and category[cite: 12].
* **View Expenses**: A dynamic display of all recorded transactions.
* **Modify Expense**: The ability to select and update the details of an existing transaction.
* **Expense Statistics**: Tools to view summaries of spending, such as total expenses by category or average daily spending.

## How to Run the Application
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ITSS4381_GroupProject_ExpenseManager.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd ITSS4381_GroupProject_ExpenseManager`
3. **Install dependencies**: (e.g., `pip install Flask`)
4. **Run the application**: `python app.py`
5. [cite_start]**Open in browser**: The application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the specified host and port)[cite: 13].

## Vibe Coding Process
[cite_start]This project was built with the assistance of AI tools[cite: 10]. [cite_start]The development process involved using specific prompts to generate boilerplate code for the web framework, design the HTML forms, and connect the frontend to the backend data logic[cite: 21]. [cite_start]We focused on iterating with the AI to achieve a working, functional application quickly, as the project timeline was one week[cite: 7, 21].
